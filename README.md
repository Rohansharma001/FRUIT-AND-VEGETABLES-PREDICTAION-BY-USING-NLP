# FRUIT-AND-VEGETABLES-PREDICTAION-BY-USING-NLP

This project, Fruit and Vegetables Prediction Using NLP, focuses on classifying and predicting fruits and vegetables based on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes text inputs such as product names, descriptions, labels, or user-provided queries and predicts whether the input corresponds to a fruit or a vegetable. This project demonstrates the application of NLP and machine learning in the food and agriculture domain.

## Methodology

The project begins with data collection containing fruit and vegetable names and descriptions. Text preprocessing steps include lowercasing, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming or lemmatization. Feature extraction is performed using techniques such as Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF to convert text into numerical vectors. Machine learning classification algorithms are then trained on these features to perform accurate predictions
